<h2>Getting Started</h2>
This book uses ES modules syntax whereas in my code, I will be using CommonJS modules. More information on the differences can be found here [CommonJs vs. ES Modules](https://blog.logrocket.com/commonjs-vs-es-modules-node-js/)

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
MERN stands for:<br />
M - MongoDB<br />
E - Express<br />
R - React<br />
N - Node<br />

So it is important that you are familiar with each of these technologies as well as HTML,CSS, and JavaScript before purchasing/reading this book.
 
<h2>Packages</h2>
There are several packages used in this project and they make life a whole lot easier. 

If you use VS Code remember to use the following command in the terminal to create a package.json file

    npm init -y
